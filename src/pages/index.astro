						I am an Automotive Software Engineer operating at the intersection of embedded systems and cloud architecture. With a deep foundation in automotive powertrain controls and embedded software at major OEMs my role has evolved to bridge the gap between the vehicle and the cloud. I actively integrate Cloud Compute, Machine Learning, and AI technologies into my workflow. From architecting solutions on AWS or GCP to deploying Machine Learning models for vehicle data and analytics, I bring a DevOps and Data Science skillset to the automotive world.

						On the lighter side of things, I believe that family, friends, and health are the true drivers of a fulfilling life. I am passionate about travel, tech, AI, productivity, health optimization, real estate investing, and hiking/backpacking.

					<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 opacity-90">
						I believe the most important things in life are human connection, community, helping others and genuinely being passionate about the work you do. Whether I’m architecting a solution in Kubernetes, hiking a new trail, or focusing on health and wellness, I approach every challenge with the same energy: “find what you love, and give it everything you have”.
